# specflow-samples

Samples of [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) projects and build/run on Azure DevOps (build & release pipelines).

## Requirements

Follow the [getting started](https://specflow.org/getting-started) page.

Read the [Unit Test Providers](https://specflow.org/documentation/Unit-Test-Providers/) page to know more about test runners.

## Limitations

At the current time, there is an issue with stable versions and .NET Core 3.1 SDK. We need to use 3.3 beta versions (and NUnit for beta version and all capacities).

See [issue #1912](https://github.com/SpecFlowOSS/SpecFlow/issues/1912) or [issue #1986](https://github.com/SpecFlowOSS/SpecFlow/issues/1986) for more details.
